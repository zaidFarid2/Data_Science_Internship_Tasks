Source: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset on Kaggle
Description: This dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013 over a period of two days. It comprises 284,807 transactions, with 492 cases of fraud.
Features:
Time: Time elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
V1, V2, ..., V28: These are the principal components obtained with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to protect user identities and sensitive information.
Amount: The transaction amount.
Class: The response variable, which is 1 for fraudulent transactions and 0 otherwise.
Key Challenge: The dataset is highly imbalanced, meaning the number of fraudulent transactions is significantly smaller than legitimate ones (0.172% fraudulent). This imbalance requires careful handling during data preprocessing and model training.
